# UIL
Unbound Intermediary Language

The UIL (Pronounced "Yule") is a tool for use in conjunction with a compiler, which translates UIL data to the data specified in configuration files.
This means that you can change the compilation target, just by using a different translation file. Currently, the only translation file that exists is to translate UIL data to x86 assembly
